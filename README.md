# How to launch the project
Start the **server** by running either `nodemon start` or `npm start` (you need to change the directory in the terminal to _server_ first)

Start the **client** by running `npm start` (you have to open the _client_ directory in the terminal first)

# Unit Tests
Unit tests are located under the *server* folder in the *test* subfolder - komanda/server/test/

You can run them by executing the command `npm test`
